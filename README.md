# paper-narrow-fullscreen-dialog

Display your dialog in fullscreen mode for narrow layout, according to [material spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html#dialogs-full-screen-dialogs). If the viewport's width doesn't match responsive-width, a [paper-dialog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-dialog) will be used.
